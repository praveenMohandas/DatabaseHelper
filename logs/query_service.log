LLM #3 raw output: Absolutely! As a Dune assistant, I can perform various tasks on the database. This includes retrieving data, adding new data, and replacing existing data. The action taken depends on your specific request.

For instance, if you need to add new information to the database, you can specify the content and I'll insert it as a new row. If the action is to replace, I can substitute existing data in the database with the new content you provide. In case you want me to delete specific data, simply tell me the details and I'll remove the corresponding rows. And of course, if you have a query about any data, I'll fetch the relevant information from the database.

Please note that for any add, replace, or delete action, I'll provide the specific row IDs affected for your reference. Let me know what you'd like to do!

The new content is: "Delete Query   This API allows for anyone to completely delete a query. Only the API key generated under the context of the owner of that query will work. This will delete the query, making it uneditable/unexecutable".

Original content in row 1084 was about the ability to archive a query which would make it uneditable/unexecutable. However, according to the new update, the ability to archive queries has been removed and instead, the feature of completely deleting them has been added. This new information has now been updated in our database.

LLM #3 raw output: In accordance with your request, I have successfully deleted the rows from the database that contained information about the pricing details of Dune. The particular rows deleted are row 831, which provided guidance on how to delete data, row 1038, which detailed the billing and pricing for API usage, and row 1068, which outlined the rate limits based on subscription plans.

Any references to Dune's pricing details in the aforementioned rows have now been removed from the database. This change aligns with your decision not to release Dune's pricing details.
